# 🥐 Gather

⚠️ This is a **random weekend idea**.  
If you’ve got suggestions, wild thoughts, or just wanna roast the logo contact me.

## 🌍 What is this?

**Gather** is the app where your local barista’s poetry night, your neighbor’s salsa class, and that mysterious “board game meetup” all finally find a home.  

It’s like Instagram events, but without the 4,000 unrelated selfies.  
It’s like Eventbrite, but without the corporate energy.  
It’s like a group chat, but less chaos and more burnt-orange.

## 🦑 Features (™ Totally Real)

- **Post an event** → if approved by the all-powerful admin overlord.  
- **Register for stuff** → free events? click. paid events? wait for approval, peasant.  
- **Capacity counters** → because you deserve to know if you’ll be one of 3 people or 300.  
- **An actual color palette** → behold, burnt orange supremacy.

## 📦 Installation  

You don’t want to. Trust me.  
But if you insist:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/totally-real/gather.git
cd gather
npm install
npm start
```

If that fails, congrats, you’ve unlocked the true developer experience.

# 🛑 Disclaimer

Gather will not:

- Get you a date.

- Teach you latte art.

- Guarantee your event isn’t just 2 dudes and a dog.

But it will make your calendar look 13% cooler.
